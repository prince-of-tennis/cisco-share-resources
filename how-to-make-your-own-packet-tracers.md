**DO NOT** ```DO WR```

2. Extensions -> Activity Wizard and add a password
3. Begin checking off all the items you want scored
   - can show completion percentage
4. Copy initial network from answer network
5. Clear what you want to clear and/or lock specific items

   ```
   erase startup-config
   del vlan.dat

   ```
   - on pc/server, click on dhcp and back to static in *IP Configuration*
