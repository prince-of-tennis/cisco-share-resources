# Cyber Resources
## cisco
Cisco resources that are openly shareable according to the rules set out in the competition guidelines, primarily geared towards the national CyberPatriot Competition.

### cisco tips
- download the commands list (publicly available from cisco)
- read the netacad curriculum, ik it's pain but it's worth it, trust :)
- practice the pkas on your own, doesn't hurt to review, the skill integration ones are extra nice (especially the ccna one)
