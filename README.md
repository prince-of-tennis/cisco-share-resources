# Cisco Networking Resources
## What this is
Cisco resources that are openly shareable according to the rules set out in the competition guidelines, primarily geared towards the national CyberPatriot Competition.

## Some General Tips for Competitors
- download the commands list (publicly available from cisco)
- read the netacad curriculum, ik it's pain but it's worth it, trust :)
- practice the pkas on your own, doesn't hurt to review, the skill integration ones are extra nice (especially the ccna one)


For more detailed tips, see [Cisco Networking in CyberPatriot](https://github.com/prince-of-tennis/cisco-share-resources/blob/main/cisco/Cisco%20Networking%20in%20CyberPatriot.md#cisco-networking-in-cyberpatriot), a little brain dump of strategies I wrote in my free time.
