# Cisco Networking Resources
Cisco resources that are openly shareable according to the rules set out in the competition guidelines, geared towards the national CyberPatriot Competition.

## Tips
- download the commands list (publicly available from cisco)
- read the Netacad curriculum, ik it's pain but it's worth it, trust :)
- practice the pkas on your own, doesn't hurt to review, the skill integration ones are extra nice (especially the ccna one)
- for extra difficulty, maybe look into making your own Packet Tracer. Here's [something](https://medium.com/@taiyu_chen/make-your-own-packet-tracer-lab-ea07c8f883a) to get you started.

For more detailed tips, see [Cisco Networking in CyberPatriot](/cisco-networking-in-cypat.md), a little brain dump of strategies I put together.
